# Front End TechDegree Project 4

In the fourth project of my Front End TechDegree with Treehouse, I was tasked with recreating designs provided in the resources folder using scss to organize components of the CSS, convert colors and sizes used in multiples places to variables, use mixins for all media queries that accept a size parameter, and various other tasks.

This project was created using HTML, CSS, and SCSS, built in VS Code, tested in Chrome Version 78.0.3904.97, Firrefox 71.0 (20191202093317), and unfortunately Internet Explorer Version 11.418.18362.0
